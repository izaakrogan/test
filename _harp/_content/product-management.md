# Product Management Training

## Who would want to do this training?

You are commissioning development work for Web and mobile and you want to get value from the process.

## What problem does this training solve?

Developing a software product is expensive. It is very easy to spend a lot of money and still not get what you want. Even if you outsource the whole process, you—as the *product owner*—need to understand the development process in order to get the most out of it.

## What does the training offer?

The training covers key aspects of product management, including *user experience design* and *agile project management*. What sets this training apart is that you will get to work with your own develpment team with whom you will develop a real-world protype of your product.

## How does it work?

The training consists of a full day of training and practice followed by a week of continued communication with your development team to deliver your prototype.

### Day 1

On Monday morning, you will be introduced to your development team and together you will receive a day of training and practice in user experience design and agile project management.

You will help in producing a series of *wireframes* and *user stories*. Then you will be introduced to *agile project management* using *Pivotal Tracker™*. 

### Days 2-4

Throughout the rest of the week, you will be able to practice what you have learnt in the role of *product owner* for your project. 

You will continue to communicate with your team using *Pivotal Tracker™* as they work through the user stories that you defined together on the first day. 

### Day 5

On Friday afternoon, you will re-join your team for a *sprint review*, *project retrospective* and product handover.
