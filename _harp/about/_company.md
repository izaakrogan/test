# About us

*Founders & Coders C.I.C.* is an organisation like no other. We provide the industry's leading training in full-stack JavaScript. We donâ€™t charge our students a penny and all the profits we make from placing our graduates go back into improving the quality of our training programme.

Our aim is to provide the best possible training in web development - for free. We manage this through the support of our mentors, the tech communtiy and our graduates, who often join our faculty to help to teach future cohorts.
