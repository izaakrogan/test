# Pooling developer talent through free education

A community of developers named Founders & Coders are creating a pool of talent for IT employers to cherry-pick via its own peer-led, free education course.

Based in London's Mile End, the 16-week course in software development for the web aims to give students with no previous technical experience sufficient skills to find employment as a software developer.

The graduates are currently working on a variety of paid post-graduate projects, including a major new website for Camden Council and web apps for two early-stage startups. The community are searching for more employers willing to offer the graduates projects to work on.

The course runs for a total of 16 weeks and is split into eight weeks of training and eight weeks of working on projects the community has found through freelancing.
