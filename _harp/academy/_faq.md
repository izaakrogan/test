**What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?**     
The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The *Founders & Coders* community.

**Who is this programme suitable for?**    
There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme.

Very. We get many applicants for each place.

**How much does it cost?**     
There are no fees.

**How are you supporting yourselves?**    
By working on freelance projects. None of us is paid for teaching or mentoring on the programme.

**If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?**    
We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.

**How can I give something back?**    
After the 16-week programme is finished, help us deliver the programme to our next cohort of students.

**Can I become a part of Founders & Coders?**    
We are a freelance co-operative. While you are studying with us, you are treated as a non-paying member of the co-operative. After you have completed the 16-week training programme, you may, if you wish, join us as a full fee-paying member.
