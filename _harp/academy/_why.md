# Why JavaScript?

We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScript is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like *PhoneGap* and now Facebook's *React* library, it can be used for *iPhone* and *Android* development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.
 
In general, we have found that employers are often reluctant to employ inexperienced junior developers to work on their server-side application software. As a result, graduates of our training programmes have found it easier to find work as front-end developers and that means that *in almost every case* JavaScript is the language that they need to learn to break into the job market.
 
We have previously attempted to introduce two or more languages into our training programmes, and have for example used Python extensively in previous courses, but this is not unlike attempting to offer a language immersion course simultaneously in French and German. It is likely to confuse introductory-level students and diminish their ability to make progress in either language.
