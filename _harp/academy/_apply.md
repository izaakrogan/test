# Applications

We are now taking applications for the course starting on January 11th, based at our Bethnal Green campus.

## The application process

+ [Application form, Part 1](apply1.html) (the shorter one)
+ [Application form, Part 2](apply2.html) (the longer one)

We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).

We also now run a pre-course programme. The aim of the programme is to give promising candidates a chance to continue with their preparation in a supportive environment, while also volunteering to work as part of a small business development team. Just check the "I am interested in participating in the internship programme" box when completing the application form.

## Application deadlines

+ First application deadline: September 7th.
+ Second application deadline: October 5th.
+ Third application deadline: November 2nd.
+ Final application deadline: December 7th.

We aim to accept around four applicants after each deadline. We do it this way, so that applicants can get feedback on their application within a month or so of applying. Early applicants will either get a confirmed place or (so long as they continue to make progress with the prerequisites) their application will remain in the applicant pool until the final deadline.

## Application criteria

We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive. we will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.

+ Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes;
+ Reach at least 5 kyu on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript);

If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars, getting familiar with GitHub, and getting to the point where you feel comfortable asking questions on Stackoverflow will take time.

But please do not be daunted. We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, use our Gitter channel, and if you live in London consider signing up for our [Monday evening meetups](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/).
