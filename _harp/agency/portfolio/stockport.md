An online hub for advice and support to aid those affected by suicide.

##Challenge

There are around 6500 suicides every year in the UK and Republic of Ireland alone. This averages out to around 17 per day, or one every 90 minutes.

The Stockport Suicide Prevention Leadership Committee, in collaboration with Stockport Council, contacted us with a brief to build a website that would serve both as an advice and support platform for those affected by suicide, and a collection of useful resources from other organisations. The focus would be on services available within Stockport and the Greater Manchester area, although the advice and support information would be applicable to anyone in the world struggling with the stress of suicide.

A text-heavy display and tight UI design specifications proved challenging to implement, especially on tablet and mobile devices. The importance of not restricting access for any potential user made backwards compatibility a high priority.

##Solution

A two-person team, consisting of one in-house and one remote developer, implemented the specification using the _Jekyll_ platform, deployed on GitHub pages. Following Agile methodologies, the site was deployed early and continuously. A tight feedback loop between client and developers allowed for rapid integration of client requirements, as the design evolved and was refined during the build processs.

##Results

An informative, supportive resource that is easily accessible for all, can offer help to those who need it at a critical time, and make a significant difference to people's lives.
