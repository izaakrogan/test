##Challenge

Coot Freight acts as an intermediary between shipping companies and customers. They help organise, optimise and order shipping services. Previously, Coot Freight used Excel for managing the core component of their business. The challenge for Founders & Coders was to develop a tool that would streamline these processes.

##Solution

After the production of wireframes and user stories, the first sprint resulted in an alpha application, deployed to Travis. With this foundation, the team worked in fortnightly sprints, continuously integrating and continuously communicating with the client. This ensured that the client remained involved throughout the build and the resulting product would be to their exact specification.

##Result

The result optimised many aspects of our client's processes. The system can manage orders, organise contacts, schedule reminders and automatically create pre-defined forms for communication with  customers. The system also helps the team stay informed, by presenting information clearly and concisly.
