##Challenge
In this foundational project, we partnered with <a href="http://www.revolution.works/" target="_blank">Revolution Works</a> to build a distinctive publishing platform for insightful ideas and innovations that improve African life. The platform would aggregate the work of researchers, pioneers and writers across African society into beautiful collections called Briefcases, each containing a set of Briefs covering a wide range of topics.

##Solution
After the production of meticulous wireframes and user stories, the project began with the production of an alpha application. Starting from this foundation, the team worked in fortnightly sprints, using agile principles until completion. Our processes ensured quality, timing and flexibility.
