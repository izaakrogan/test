##Challenge

IC publications needed an image handling service to integrate into their existing platform. This service would allow their photographers, working around the world, to upload images, curate these images into collections and make them available to ICP's global audience.

##Solution

Starting with the production of extensive wireframes and user stories, the team worked in fortnightly sprints, using agile principles until completion. Our processes ensured quality, timing and flexibility.

##Results

An elegant and robust solution, which integrates well with ICPâ€™s other services.
