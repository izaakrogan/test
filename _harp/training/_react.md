**Learn Reactjs**	
Date TBD

A weekend workshop on Facebook's [*React*](https://facebook.github.io/react/)â€”a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

*How to think in React*	 
The first of is an introductory, interactive workshop in which you will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of React, learn how to set up your dev environment for an optimal workflow, and how to start building your own library of components for reuse across projects. Some knowledge of JavaScript is expected, but other than that, all you need is a laptop and an inquisitive mind!  

*Building a real-world app in React*	   
A follow-up to How to think in React, in which we will learn how to apply the concepts already learnt through building an app. To get the most out of this workshop, you will either have attended *How to think in React* or will already have a good working knowledge of React fundamentals.

<!-- *Introduction to Flux*	
In the third of three workshops on *React*,  we will be converting a purely *React* app into one built with the *Flux* design pattern. By doing so, you will be able to see why you might want to use Flux if you're using React, and how you might start going about changing your app accordingly.  To get the most out of this workshop, you will either have attended our earlier workshops or you will have some experience with using React, and you understand the difference between *state* and *props*, where state should lie, and how components can set the state of other components. -->
