**'Git' Comfortable with the Command Line and Version Control**	
Date TBD	

If you have been dipping your toes into the world of coding, you will probably have quickly realised that in order to install most tools and frameworks, you need to interact with the command line (terminal window).

Or perhaps you would like to use Github or collaborate with other developers and need to learn git. But interacting with your computer using the command line can be very intimidating at first.

In this course we aim to teach you the fundamentals of working in the command line and the version control software, git. You will walk away with a new found knowledge and confidence to start using the command line.
