      <h2>Our People</h2>
      <p>Our students are exceptionally motivated. Applicants need to put in around 200h of work before we consider them in the selection process. The 5% of applicants that get excepted are passionate learners. We value hard work, talent and diversity - with around 40% of our intake being female and many from groups underrepresented in the tech industry. Our selection process is simple: We take people we would want to work with at our own startups.</p>
