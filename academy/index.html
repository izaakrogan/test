		<h1>The programme</h1><p><img src="/assets/fac-logo.png" class="fac-logo"></p>
<p>Founders &amp; Coders runs the most complete course in software development in the UK.</p>

		<div id="apply"></div>
		<h1>Applications</h1><p>We are now taking applications for the course starting on January 11th, based at our Bethnal Green campus.</p>
<h2>The application process</h2><ul>
<li><a href="apply1.html">Application form, Part 1</a> (the shorter one)</li>
<li><a href="apply2.html">Application form, Part 2</a> (the longer one)</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also request a short in-person paired programming session (remote sessions can also be arranged).</p>
<p>We also now run a pre-course programme. The aim of the programme is to give promising candidates a chance to continue with their preparation in a supportive environment, while also volunteering to work as part of a small business development team. Just check the &quot;I am interested in participating in the internship programme&quot; box when completing the application form.</p>
<h2>Application deadlines</h2><ul>
<li>First application deadline: September 7th.</li>
<li>Second application deadline: October 5th.</li>
<li>Third application deadline: November 2nd.</li>
<li>Final application deadline: December 7th.</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to accept around four applicants after each deadline. We do it this way, so that applicants can get feedback on their application within a month or so of applying. Early applicants will either get a confirmed place or (so long as they continue to make progress with the prerequisites) their application will remain in the applicant pool until the final deadline.</p>
<h2>Application criteria</h2><p>We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive. we will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply early</li>
<li>Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes;</li>
<li>Reach at least 5 kyu on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Codewars</a>;</li>
<li>Create some kata on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/new">CodeWars</a>;</li>
<li>Ask or answer some questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2660363/dejs">stackoverflow</a>;</li>
<li>Get active on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>; create some pull requests, open some issues, and make some commits;</li>
<li>Contribute to <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone">our community on GitHub</a>
(we will send you an invitation to join when you complete Part 1 of the application);</li>
<li>Be active in  <a href="https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone">our Gitter chatroom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars, getting familiar with GitHub, and getting to the point where you feel comfortable asking questions on Stackoverflow will take time.</p>
<p>But please do not be daunted. We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, use our Gitter channel, and if you live in London consider signing up for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/">Monday evening meetups</a>.</p>

		<div id="prerequisites"></div>
		<h1>Course prerequisites</h1><p>Before you join us, you will be expected to complete all the material below. If you have any doubts about your ability to complete any of it, please contact us before the start of the course.</p>
<h2>Code</h2><p><strong>Codecademy</strong><br>If you are not at all familiar with web programming, Codecademy is a good place to start. We recommend the following tracks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">HTML &amp; CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery">jQuery</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/">Make an interactive website</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects">Web Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube">YouTube API</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communities</strong><br>Once you are somewhat familiar with Javascript, you should join Codewars, Stackoverflow and GitHub. We will also invite you to join the <em>Coding for everyone</em> community on GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Sign up for Codewars</a>, join the Founders &amp; Coders clan and reach at least Novice level with their JavaScript challenges.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Sign up for Stack Overflow</a> and start asking questions.   </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Sign up for GitHub</a> and contribute to <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone">Coding for everyone</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong><br><a href="http://flukeout.github.io/#">CSS Diner</a>. A great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are: <em>plate</em>, <em>bento</em> and <em>#fancy</em>. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.</p>
<p><strong>Typing</strong><br>Learn to touch type. And make sure that you know not just the main letter keys, but all the outer keys, too. There are many good teaching apps, but <a href="http://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>
<p><strong>Books</strong><br>We like <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>. It is available free online and includes a number of embedded code snippets that you can edit and run as you read. You may also want to look at <a href="https://watchandcode.com/courses/eloquent-javascript-the-annotated-version">The Annotated Version</a>.</p>
<p>We just keep coming back to <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>. Keep it by your bedside. Re-read Chapter weekly until it begins to sink in. Go to sleep each night dreaming in JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Articles</strong>    </p>
<p>For fun, read <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">Steve Yegge&#39;s Google platforms rant</a>. <em>&quot;Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there&#39;s one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups&quot;</em>.</p>

		<div id="faq"></div>
		<h1>FAQ</h1><p><strong>What is the Founders &amp; Coders programme?</strong><br>It is a 16-week programme of study in software development for the web.</p>
<p><strong>What is the aim of the programme?</strong><br>To give students sufficient skills to create web applications and find employment as a web developer.</p>
<p><strong>What is the structure of the programme?</strong><br>It is divided into two parts: an eight-week foundation course followed by eight weeks working on real-world projects.</p>
<p><strong>How is the foundation course delivered?</strong><br>As a full-time classroom-based course running Monday to Friday from 10am to 7pm at our campus in Bethnal Green.</p>
<p><strong>How is the classroom organised?</strong><br>Courses are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns to deliver seminars, run code reviews and manage projects.</p>
<p><strong>What does the curriculum cover?</strong><br>Primarily, we cover <em>test-driven</em> development, using <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Node.js</em>. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>What projects will I work on in the second half of the programme?</strong><br>We aim to give you an opportunity to work on a variety of open source, charitable, social enterprise, startup and commercial projects. The programme is under continuous development and the balance between learning and earning a living is under review.  </p>
<p><strong>What are the main reasons to apply for this programme?</strong><br>The quality of the learning experience. The commitment of your fellow students. The <em>Founders &amp; Coders</em> community.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this programme suitable for?</strong><br>There are no academic requirements, but you need to be self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.</p>
<p><strong>Why are the prerequisites so tough</strong><br>This programme is challenging and you need to be well-prepared. We aim for a zero drop-out rate, so we need to know that you are serious about becoming a developer before we accept you on to the programme. </p>
<p><strong>How competitive is the entry?</strong><br>Very. We get many applicants for each place.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br>There are no fees.</p>
<p><strong>How are you supporting yourselves?</strong><br>By working on freelance projects. None of us is paid for teaching or mentoring on the programme.</p>
<p><strong>If this programme is so good, why are you offering it for free?</strong><br>We are trying to build a community and we do not think we can do that by charging an entry fee.</p>
<p><strong>How can I give something back?</strong><br>After the 16-week programme is finished, help us deliver the programme to our next cohort of students.</p>
<p><strong>Can I become a part of Founders &amp; Coders?</strong><br>We are a freelance co-operative. While you are studying with us, you are treated as a non-paying member of the co-operative. After you have completed the 16-week training programme, you may, if you wish, join us as a full fee-paying member.</p>

		<div id="why"></div>
		<h1>Why JavaScript?</h1><p>We love many languages, including C, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lisp, Go and Haskell, but JavaScript is the language of the Web. You cannot be a front-end Web developer without knowing JavaScript. With the arrival into the mainstream of Node.js, JavaScript is now an excellent choice for back-end Web development. And with new technologies like <em>PhoneGap</em> and now Facebook&#39;s <em>React</em> library, it can be used for <em>iPhone</em> and <em>Android</em> development, too. If you want to be a Web developer, JavaScript will be useful to you wherever you go.</p>
<p>In general, we have found that employers are often reluctant to employ inexperienced junior developers to work on their server-side application software. As a result, graduates of our training programmes have found it easier to find work as front-end developers and that means that <em>in almost every case</em> JavaScript is the language that they need to learn to break into the job market.</p>
<p>We have previously attempted to introduce two or more languages into our training programmes, and have for example used Python extensively in previous courses, but this is not unlike attempting to offer a language immersion course simultaneously in French and German. It is likely to confuse introductory-level students and diminish their ability to make progress in either language.</p>
